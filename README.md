# Pre Build Data Structures and Algo in c++

### Array Operations header file
this file contains all the ds and algo on the d simple array

ex -
1. traverse array
2. insert at particular position 
3. delete from particular position 
4. delete values by finding them 
5. reverse a array 
6. normal searching 
7. binary search
8. sort array using bubble short
9. remove duplicate elements from the array

### Matrix Operations header file
this file contains all the ds and algo on the 2d matrix

ex - 
1. transpose matrix
2. increasing matrix size
3. adding two matrix
4. mutiplying two matrix 
5. taking input from user in vector form 
6. print matrix 
7. print matrix in spiral form 
8. finding saddle point
9. reducing special matrix like diagonal , tridiagonal , triangular etc
