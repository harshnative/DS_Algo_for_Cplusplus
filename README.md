# Data Structures and Algo in c++ (for reference and pre build algo's)

## Array Operations header file
this file contains all the ds and algo on the d simple array

ex -
1. traverse array
2. insert at particular position 
3. delete from particular position 
4. delete values by finding them 
5. reverse a array 
6. normal searching 
7. binary search
8. sort array using bubble short
9. remove duplicate elements from the array

## Matrix Operations header file
this file contains all the ds and algo on the 2d matrix

ex - 
1. transpose matrix
2. increasing matrix size
3. adding two matrix
4. mutiplying two matrix 
5. taking input from user in vector form 
6. print matrix 
7. print matrix in spiral form 
8. finding saddle point

## singlyLinked list header file
this file represent the singly linked list implementation

ex - 
1. creating a singly linked list
2. get the pointer to a certain position in a linked list
3. inserting in a singly linked list
4. traversing a singly list list


#### And many more

## Circular Linked list Header File -

this file represent the circular linked list implementation

ex - 

1. return the last node of the circular linked list 
2. add to a empty circular linked list
3. add to the beginning in a circular linked list
4. add after a certain position in linked list 
5. add to the end of the linked list
6. check whether a linked list is circular or note
7. delete a node at a certain position in circular linked list
8. get a node position of the first apperance of the key
9. get a node after a certain pos
10. get the lenght of linked list

## Doubly Linked list Header File -

this file represent the doubly linked list implementation

ex - 

1. add node at the beginning of the linked list
2. display from head
3. display from tail
4. get the lenght of linked list
